# write_mats.ado 
## Another solution to export stata tables into Latex

This repository contains not only ``write_mats.ado``, but also a few examples in stata and latex showing how I tipically use this utility. This utility is not a substitute for tools like estout/esttab, but I find it useful in my workflow and for whenever I need to create a non-standard table. 

For example, often we need to create a table when only one coefficient from a particular regression is of interest, and we want to combine estimated effects from multiple outcomes or specifications such as this.
